# Guided Research Project: Data Pipeline Monitoring and Alerting

**Introduction**

This project aims to conduct a comparative study of indexing techniques in two widely used relational database management systems, MySQL and PostgreSQL. The study focuses on evaluating and comparing the performance of these databases under various indexing scenarios using a real-world dataset.

**Project Description**

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to explore the impact of indexing on query performance in MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. Indexing is a critical database optimization technique that can significantly enhance data retrieval efficiency. By investigating the effectiveness of different indexing strategies, this study aims to provide valuable insights for database administrators and developers to make informed decisions on optimizing query performance for their applications.

Dataset:
The project uses the "employees" database, which comprises six tables: salaries, titles, employees, dept_emp, departments, and dept_manager. The dataset is obtained from a reputable source and has been imported into both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. To ensure a fair comparison, all existing indexes, primary keys, and foreign keys have been removed from the dataset.
