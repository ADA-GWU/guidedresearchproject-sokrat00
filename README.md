# Guided Research Project: Data Pipeline Monitoring and Alerting

**Introduction**

This repository contains the code and documentation for the summer project on Data Monitoring and Alerting. The aim of this project is to design and implement a web application using Flask framework that allows users to monitor data and receive real-time alerts when problems are detected. The project focuses on enhancing data quality, ensuring prompt identification of issues, and providing an intuitive interface for users to manage and monitor their data.
The aim of this project s a fully functional web application built with Flask that enables users to monitor their data and receive real-time alerts. The application will have a user-friendly interface for configuring data sources, defining monitoring rules, and managing alerts. Users will be able to visualize and analyze their data, ensuring data quality and efficient data management.

**Project Description**

The project involves the development of a web application for data monitoring and alerting. The application allows users to configure data sources, define monitoring rules, and receive real-time alerts when problems are detected in the data. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage and monitor data pipelines, ensuring data quality and timely resolution of issues.

The main features of the application include:

 - Monitoring Rules Setup: Users can define monitoring rules to specify the conditions under which alerts should be triggered. They can set thresholds, define data validation     rules, or specify patterns to be matched in the data.
 - Alerting Mechanism: When an issue is detected in the data, the application triggers alerts to notify users in real-time. Alerts can be sent through various channels such as     email, SMS, or in-app notifications, allowing users to take immediate action.
 - Data Visualization and Analysis: The application provides visualizations and insights into the monitored data. Users can view trends, patterns, and statistics to gain a        deeper understanding of the data and identify potential issues.
